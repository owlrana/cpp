/*
        Using Binary Sort to go to mid and then we identify where we are:
            
            0. if element[mid] is the key, then just return

            1. if element[0] <= element[mid]
                --> means we are in the first half, and all we know is that the LEFT side is sorted
                We need to know if our element is within this range, 
                    --> if it is then narrow down by: end = mid - 1
                    --> if it is NOT then move out of this range by: start =  mid + 1

            2. if element[end] >= element[mid]
                --> means we are in the second half, and all we know is that RIGHT SIDE is sorted
                We need to know if our element is within this range, 
                    --> if it is then narrow down by: start = mid + 1
                    --> if it is NOT then move out of this range by: end =  mid - 1

        We use this knowledge ^ to find out where our element lies and move accordingly
